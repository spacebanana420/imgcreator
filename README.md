# imgcreator
Imgcreator is a cross-platform CLI program that quickly creates empty .img disk images. These disk image files can be used for a range of reasons, from virtual machine disks, to storing data, to creating ROMs, to store backups, to store entire disk data, etc

**This software does not work properly and I don't intend on working on this project at least for now**
